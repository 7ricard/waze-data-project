# Waze User Churn â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis

An exploratory analysis of user engagement and churn patterns in the Waze app, highlighting factors that influence retention and identifying opportunities for churn mitigation.

---

## What I Did

- Cleaned and explored user activity data (drives, recency, weekend behavior)
- Investigated missing values and removed unlabeled rows
- Engineered features: `Time to Unicorn`, `Funding (M)`, `days_since_last_trip`
- Visualized user churn vs retention and correlations with activity
- Summarized key behavioral indicators associated with churn

---

## Key Insights

- **Churn rate is ~72%**, indicating potential engagement challenges or aggressive churn definition
- **Recent activity** and **total drive count** are highly correlated with retention
- **Weekend usage** may signal habitual users more likely to stay active
- The dataset skews toward **newer users** with low drive counts
